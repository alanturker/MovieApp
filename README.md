# MovieApp

My main goal in this application was to improve my networking experience. I used third party pods like Alamofire, Moya and Kingfisher while writing. When you log in to the application, three options appear; Popular, Upcoming and Search. You can search for movies by name in the Search section, and at the same time, it shows top rated movies by default so that it doesn't stay empty when you first enter. When you click on the films, it directs you to the details, where you can see the score and cast of the film. Its design is not very good, but as I said, it was an application that I made for learning purposes.
